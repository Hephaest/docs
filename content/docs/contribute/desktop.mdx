We've taken the time to make building Zen Browser as easy as possible, independent of your operating system or technical knowledge.

#### Basic Requirements  

The following resources are essential for a successful build. Without them, you will encounter unnecessary build failures:  

- Disk Space: Keep _30GB_ of free space on the disk (the build process is resource-intensive).  
- Git ([Download here](https://git-scm.com/downloads)) – Required for version control and managing source code.  
- Python 3 ([Download here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)) – Needed for running build scripts and automation tools.   
- Node.js 21+ ([Download here](https://nodejs.org/)) – Required for managing dependencies and running JavaScript-based tools.    
- MozillaBuild ([Download here](https://wiki.mozilla.org/MozillaBuild)) – Required for `mach` and Gecko compilation.  
- 7-Zip ([Download here](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html)) – Used to extract Firefox source archives.  
- sccache ([Download here](https://github.com/mozilla/sccache/releases)) – A caching tool that speeds up rebuilds by storing compiled objects.    

<Callout>
If you're using Windows, ensure that all the basic software requirements are added to the `PATH` variable.

<Callout type="warn">
We cannot provide support if a build fails. Please understand this before proceeding with the following steps.

## Step 1: Clone the Project

First, you need to clone the Zen Browser repository to your local machine. This will create a local copy of the project that you can work on.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zen-browser/desktop.git --recurse-submodules --depth 10
cd desktop
```

- **`--recurse-submodules`**: This flag ensures that all submodules are cloned along with the main project. Zen Browser relies on several submodules, so this step is essential.
- **`--depth 10`**: This makes sure you dont download the entire git history, it would take a long time otherwise due to that we used to store compiled binaries on the repository.

## Step 2: Install Dependencies

Once you have cloned the project, navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm i
```

This command will install all the packages listed in the `package.json` file, which are required for building and running Zen Browser.

## Step 3: Download and Bootstrap the Browser

To set up the browser, you need to download additional files and prepare the environment:

```bash
npm run init
```

This command handles all the necessary bootstrapping tasks, such as setting up configuration files and downloading essential resources.

## Step 4: Update Language Packs

Before building the browser, it’s recommended to update the American English language packs to ensure that all localization files are up-to-date:

```bash
python3 ./scripts/update_en_US_packs.py
```

This script updates the "en-US" localization files, which are necessary for proper language support in Zen Browser. Running this step ensures that your build includes the latest translations and language resources.

## Step 5: Build the Browser

Now that everything is set up, you can build the browser:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command compiles the source code and creates the necessary files for running Zen Browser.

- If your changes are only in JavaScript, you can run the following command after completing the first build for faster rebuilds:  

  ```bash
  npm run build:ui
  ```  

  This skips unnecessary compilation steps and only rebuilds the UI components.  

For changes in other languages or core functionality, you should always run the full build using `npm run build` after every code change.  

## Step 6: Run the Browser

After building the browser, you can start it using:

```bash
npm start
```

This command launches the browser, allowing you to see your changes in action.

### Common Build Errors & Fixes

#### Q: "mach not found" error?  
> Install [MozillaBuild](https://wiki.mozilla.org/MozillaBuild), add it to your `PATH`, then restart your terminal.

#### Q: "7z" or "7-Zip" missing during build?  
> Download [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/), add it to your `PATH`, then restart your terminal.

#### Q: "Unsupported Microsoft Visual Studio version" or build failing for similar reasons on Windows?  
> Ensure Visual Studio is installed with the "Desktop development with C++" workload and Windows 10/11 SDK.

#### Q: Build stuck or freezing?  
> Try running with fewer threads:  
> ```sh
> npm run build -- --jobs 2
> ```  

#### Q: "Git submodule" errors after cloning?  
> Run:  
> ```sh
> git submodule update --init --recursive
> ```  

#### Q: "npm run init" fails?  
> Manually bootstrap the project:  
> ```sh
> npm run bootstrap
> ```  

#### Q: "zen.exe" not found after build?  
> Perform a clean rebuild:  
> ```sh
> npm run reset-ff && npm run init && npm run build
> ```
